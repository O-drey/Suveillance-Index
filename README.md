# Suveillance-Index
Course : Design On Screen <br>
Time : January 2020 - April 2020 <br><br>

Instructions: Create a web page for an exhibition that can function independently. The page must present the work of the artist, based on existing content.  <br>

I chose to present the work of Marck Gunheim, Surveillance Index, exhibited at the BAL. <br>
The work is a collection of photo books on civilian surveillance. I chose to add a trail effect to the cursor on a map that makes this tracing of people visible. The Javascript code was done by Marcin Wojtowicz on Javascript Kit. I encountered different problems like the straightening of the map which is flattened, or the enlargement and appearance of the text which should be activated when the cursor passes over it, I wanted the information to be hidden until the cursor passes over it in order to imitate the digital cookies, but this version of the project was not retained.
